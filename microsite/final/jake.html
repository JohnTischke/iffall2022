                    <h2>Jake the Dog</h2>
                    <h4>Jake is the confidant, the dependable buddy, the designated driver for when Finn gets all tuckered out. He's the crutch when he falls, the guiding hand to lift him back up, Jake is Finn's best friend. Jake is like an older brother or cool uncle to Finn. Sure, they're both pretty young but, in dog years, Jake's 28-years-old. Finn can always turn to Jake for advice about things that confused him, mostly girls. His reassuring presence lets Finn feel free to act like a goofball.</h4>

                    <h3>A True Best Friend</h3>
                    <p>And Finn's goofball presence inspires Jake to act like a silly nut too. Sillyness is infectious between these two. Once Finn draws a mustache on his back and starts walking around on his hands, Jake can't help but join in. I mean... how could you not?</p>

            <h3 style="margin:0;">A Real Supportive Brother</h3>
            <p>Jake has awise but playful manner about him. His relationship with Finn is similar to Bill Murray's character relating to Rudy in the movie Meatballs. Like Murray, Jake is very jokey, everything can be poked fun at until it gets serious. And when it's serious, like when Finn in feeling low or sad, Jake is good at listening and knowing the most thoughtful thing to say. Finn looks up to Jake in this way. In turn, Jake looks up to Finn for his passionate do-gooding.</p>

            <h3 style="margin:0;">He Has Passions</h3>
            <p>Jake's great passion is music. He's in a viola band with hsi girlfriend Lady the Rainicorn. They practice every Thursday in Princess Bubblegum's garage (unless an adventure is underway). Sometimes he'll improvise songs on the spot, even during action intense escapades. At times he can be so taken yb his own humming that his mind will wander and won't be able to hear anything but the sweet music in his head. Finn just has to say the word, though, and Jake gets back to action. That word is "ADVENTURE!"</p>
