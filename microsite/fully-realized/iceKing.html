                    <h4>He's a bad egg, this guy. Armed with a magical crown and a frozen heart, The Ice King is a threat to everyone who crosses him and even himself. Ambitious. Ruthless. An incredible dork. The Ice King is a 1000-year-old socially inept patoot who will stop at nothing to be accepted as the cool potential bovfriend to an unlucky Princess or Ice Lady. </h4>

            <h3>Chilly Guy</h3>
            <p>The Ice King has power over all things chilly. With his ice magic he can turn snow balls into icy spikes, mold monsters out of refrigerator frost and even turn your dog's nose against you. But his magic is always used for his own selfish aims. He likes to build giant ice monuments of himself in heroic (or sometimes sexy) poses and then cry as they melt. The Ice King has MAJOR ISSUES.</p>

            <h3>A Real Hater</h3>
            <p>The Ice King hates Finn and Jake. He hates their care-free rocken-out attitudes so much that he'll spend entire afternoons just cursing them and conjuring monsters to destroy them! But secretly... The Ice King is jealous of how suave and confident Finn and Jake are. And it's quite apparent that (beneath all of his cold disdain) he is trying to be cool like Finn and Jake. When he is spying on the dudes from behind bushes he'll try to emulate how they walk and say phrases like "totally mathematical" and "fantastic rhombus ride." But when he inevitably fails at being cool, the Ice King flies off the handle and attacks Finn and Jake with frozen lightning bolts! Sheesh! Finn and Jake need to kick that guy's butt or have a sit down heart-to-heart with him or something.</p>

            <h3>HOA Violations</h3>
            <p>The Ice Mountains are the Ice King's own vast deathtrap. He's sculpted the mountains into a jagged labyrinth of crevasses and pitfalls. The country is populated with terrible monsters that are kept fed with reckless intruders and tap dancing penguins. Surrounded by blasted wasteland, The Iee King rules on high from his wintry fortress. His personal life might be a mess but his goals are practical. Conquer neighboring kingdoms, expand his ice fields and secure a wife by any means necessary. He's an icy thorn in the side of the eitizens of Ooo.</p>
