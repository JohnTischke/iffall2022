            <p>Take me away from unnecessary conversations</p>
            <p>Faithlessly patient with unintended consequences</p>

            <p>Disappearing into the ether</p>
            <p>At four o'clock in the morning</p>
            <p>With the world spinning slowly</p>
            <br>  
            <p>Remember to wake me for cemetery violations</p>
            <p>Nobody knows where the secondary catacomb could be</p>
            <br>  
            <p>Disappearing into the ether</p>
            <p>At four o'clock in the morning</p>
            <p>With the world spinning slowly</p>
            <p>When you hate what you've become</p>
            <p>And you're waiting for the day</p>
            <p>But the day waits for no one</p>
            <br>  
            <p>Carry me where we'll remain</p>
            <br>  
            <p>Sneaking away to escape impending invitations</p>
            <p>We were so close there was nothing at all between us</p>
            <br>  
            <p>Disappearing into the ether</p>
            <p>At four o'clock in the morning</p>
            <p>With the world spinning slowly</p>
            <br>  
            <p>Carry me where we'll remain</p>
            <p>And drink the rain</p>
            <p>Let down our guard</p>
            <p>And break apart</p>
            <br>  
            <p>A different strain</p>
            <p>Of fluorescent flame</p>
            <p>That's spinning through space</p>
            <p>Rejected and left in disgrace</p>
            <br>    
            <p>When you hate what you've become</p>
            <p>And you're waiting for the day</p>
            <p>But the day waits for no one</p>
