        <h1>Intro Questions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>My name is John Tischke. I am a sophomore studying Communication Design and Human-Computer Interaction.</li>
            <li>I've been doing print design work probably since middle school but I've only briefly 
                worked with web design. I took this class kinda with the thought that print is dying,
                but also because web seems cool.</li>
            <li>I've have some experience with html and css, but not really with the raw code.
                In highschool I took a web design class where we used Adobe Dreamweaver,
                so I'm familiar with a lot of the concepts, but I have almost no practice with them. </li>
            <li>I want to be able to produce some functional, engaging websites! 
                My experience is predominantly with design, so I hope learning the backend of it all
                will strengthen my understanding of good website design.</li>
            <li>It's simultaneously more and less flexible than print. You have to be able to adjust
                for different screen sizes, but also you don't simply have the freedom to place anything anywhere.
                You have to work within the logic of the code and its sectioning and stuff.</li>
            <li> <i><a href="https://whitney.org">Whitney Museum of American Art:</a></i> The Whitney's website has a super strong visual identity.
                It hits you right away with a bold, flexible, content-driven home page that that's easy and enjoyable to interact with. </li>
            <li> <i><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com">The Atlantic:</a></i> The Atlantic communicates well in the same way a newspaper does. 
                It uses visual hierarchy and categorization to communicate urgency and lead the viewer through the site with ease. </li>
            <li> <i><a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-16-preview/">Apple:</a></i> I've always been impressed by the functionality of Apple's website,
                especially their product announcement pages. Buttons click and expand smoothly. Items autoplay and scroll without hiccups.
                Rollover states are subtle yet revealing. Overall, I think they tend to be incredibly effective at leading the viewer through the information. </li>
